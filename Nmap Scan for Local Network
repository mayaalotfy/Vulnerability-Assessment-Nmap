#Here are commands from the Kali Linux terminal ,  I use 6 types of scaning

#1-ping scan ( which checks which hosts are up without scanning for open ports. This is useful for getting a list of active devices on the network.)
──(maya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sn 192.168.40.0/24     

#2-TCP connect scan (It uses the operating system's network stack to make a full TCP connection to each port in the scan range.)
──(maya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sT 192.168.40.128/24

# 3-operating system detection (This allows Nmap to guess the operating system of the scanned devices based on the characteristics of responses received during the scan.)
sudo nmap -O 192.168.40.128/24

# 4-service Version Detection (allowing Nmap to detect the versions of services running on open ports. This information is crucial for identifying outdated services that might have known vulnerabilities.)
┌──(maya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -sV 192.168.40.128/24

# 5-Script Scanning for Vulnerabilities(tells Nmap to run scripts that check for a variety of vulnerabilities against each targe)
──(maya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap --script vuln 192.168.40.128/24    

#6-Comprehensive Scan(enables aggressive scanning, which includes OS detection (-O), version detection (-sV), script scanning (--script), and traceroute (--traceroute))
(maya㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -A 192.168.40.128/24
