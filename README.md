# Vulnerability-Assessment-Nmap
In this task, I utilized the Nmap tool to perform comprehensive vulnerability scanning across both my local network and a web application (bWAPP). The assessment involved executing various Nmap scan types to identify potential security issues. The findings and analyses from these scans are detailed in a comprehensive report.
